3.1.1 Shell Operation
The following is a brief description of the shell’s operation when it reads and executes a
command. Basically, the shell does the following:
1. Reads its input from a file (see Section 3.8 [Shell Scripts], page 46), from a string
supplied as an argument to the -c invocation option (see Section 6.1 [Invoking Bash],
page 91), or from the user’s terminal.
2. Breaks the input into words and operators, obeying the quoting rules described in
Section 3.1.2 [Quoting], page 6. These tokens are separated by metacharacters. Alias
expansion is performed by this step (see Section 6.6 [Aliases], page 100).
3. Parses the tokens into simple and compound commands (see Section 3.2 [Shell Com-
mands], page 9).
4. Performs the various shell expansions (see Section 3.5 [Shell Expansions], page 24),
breaking the expanded tokens into lists of filenames (see Section 3.5.8 [Filename Ex-
pansion], page 35) and commands and arguments.
5. Performs any necessary redirections (see Section 3.6 [Redirections], page 38) and re-
moves the redirection operators and their operands from the argument list.
6. Executes the command (see Section 3.7 [Executing Commands], page 42).
7. Optionally waits for the command to complete and collects its exit status (see
Section 3.7.5 [Exit Status], page 44)"
